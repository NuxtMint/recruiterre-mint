# Senior Ninja Developer

Are you tired of loud keyboard warriors? Can you write code so silently that your colleagues won't even know you're there? StealthCode Inc. is looking for a Senior Ninja Developer who can deploy to production without making a sound!

## What you'll do:

- Silently debug production issues before anyone notices them
- Masterfully refactor legacy code like a shadow in the night
- Disappear from meetings that could have been emails
- Write self-documenting code (because ninjas don't leave traces)

## Requirements:

- 5+ years of ninja coding experience
- Black belt in TypeScript
- Ability to solve merge conflicts with your eyes closed
- Expert knowledge of Vue.js shadow DOM
- Must own at least one black hoodie

## Benefits:

- Unlimited smoke bombs for dramatic exits
- Standing desk that converts into a meditation platform
- Premium noise-canceling headphones for maximum stealth
- Ninja-grade coffee machine
- Health insurance (you probably won't need it, but just in case)

Join our shadow force of developers and help us build the future, silently!
